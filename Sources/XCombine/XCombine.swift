    /// This is an alternative implementation of the zip operator, which has some advantages over the Combine's original one. It was designed to have the same documented functionality of the original one, but is different at how it handles back pressure, in that the original zip operator just forwards the downstream's received demand up to its upstreams, while this one requests elements by 1. By acting so it prevents some problematic usage scenarios, like those with the infinite upstream sequences.
